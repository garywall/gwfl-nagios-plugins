Purpose
-------

The main reason for creating these plugins was the lack of functionality
in the standard nagios SNMP polling plugin. The nagios plugin was designed 
to poll one SNMP value, and return a very generic status string, which was 
then shown in the nagios interface. Some of these plugins poll multiple 
SNMP values, do additional calculations with the extra data, and provide 
more useful data in the web interface. The plugins that do not provide 
noteable improvements over the standard nagios plugins are included simply 
to illustrate that it is easy to create more custom plugins using the same 
format and sharing functions with the ones in this package.

These plugins were originally written for HP ProLiant DL360s running the 
HPASM System Health Agents, but since then have evolved in to supporting
more ProLiant Models/Generations. Also now included are plugins for
monitoring Cisco Catalyst Switches, Cisco Content Switches, Netscreen
Firewalls, the eSensors HVAC EM01, and generic router interfaces.

Basically all we have done is condense the data down into a format we prefer, 
and obviously make things run faster using C instead of Perl.

Requirements
------------

All of these plugins share the following requirements:

* net-snmp libraries and header files
* any libraries that SNMP has been compiled against

Except for the eSensors HVAC EM01 plugin:

* libcurl (version >= 7.9.7)

Compiling and Installation
--------------------------

If you just want the ProLiant plugins:

make proliant
make proliant-install DESTDIR=/full/path/to/destdir

And so on for the other types of plugins. If you want them
all:

make
make install DESTDIR=/full/path/to/destdir

Usage
-----

Define a command for each plugin in /etc/nagios/checkcommands.cfg,
checking <plugin> -h for arguments required/supported, add the
necessary service checks to your services.cfg, restart nagios, and 
thats it.

There are two types of plugins:

* Those meant to be run by Nagios
* Those meant to be run via cron in conjunction with FIFO-RRD

Those meant to be run by cron are plugins which return SNMP counter
values, which are more suited to RRDtool than Nagios.

Routeriface Plugins
-------------------

The plugins in the routeriface directory are not meant to be run
by Nagios. These are only useful if you are running FIFO-RRD to
create and update graphs. They are run via cron and require some
extra information to be supplied to them, the interface service
name, via the `-s' option. This is so that the interface can be
correlated to a service configured in FIFO-RRD (the Nagios service
name is usually used for this but cannot be with these plugins
since Nagios does not run them).

RFC 1628 UPS Plugins
--------------------

The check_snmp_ups_alarmonbat plugin is meant to be used by Nagios,
while the others are not. The other plugins are for trending as
explained in the Routeriface Plugins section.

Apache Plugins
--------------

These plugins were written to query Apache2 via mod_apache_snmp
(http://eplx.homeip.net/mod_apache_snmp/english/index.htm). For me
some of the MIB data was not being populated properly, which I have'nt
looked into further yet, but the two plugins included in the apache
directory work fine. The Apache plugins are special actually because
they have native cluster monitoring support (this was my requirement),
in that you can use a comma seperated arguement to `-H' to specify
multiple hosts to check.

check_snmp_apache_workers checks how many busy/idle apache processes
are running, and calculates a percentage of busyness. Supports checking
multiple hosts at once and consolidating the data.

check_snmp_apache_totalaccess is another counter checking plugin, not
meant to be run by Nagios, but via cron for handling by FIFO-RRD. This
plugin also supports checking multiple hosts at once and also has a
`-e' (entity) option, which tells the plugin to print whatever name we
want, to represent the cluster, instead of the usual hostname. 

For example:

Host entry in Nagios for www.blah.com (which is served by two boxes
running Apache2).

One service configured for this host entry in nagios:
check_snmp_apache_workers -H box1,box2 -C community -w 70 -c 90

And one check running via cron (`-e' will match the Nagios host entry name):
check_snmp_apache_totalaccess -H box1,box2 -C community -e www.blah.com

The graphs for both are displayed on the Nagios extinfo page as with
the other plugins.

BETA Plugins
------------

There are two plugins we consider beta in this package:

beta/check_snmp_phydrv_ffs - This plugin does better formatting
then check_snmp_phydrv. If you have a server connected to a disk
array which ~30 drives, check_snmp_phydrv wont cut it, there are
too many drives and the output from the plugins will be too long.
This is where check_snmp_phydrv_ffs comes in handy.

em01/check_http_em01 - A plugin for the eSensors EM01 temperature
sensor. It works but several things in it need to be fixed.
